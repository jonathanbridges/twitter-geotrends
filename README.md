# Twitter Geotrends

## Overview

Twitter Geotrends is a data visualization of the most popular hashtags and Tweets on Twitter. The data can be sorted by geolocation to uncover trends and insight about regions other than your own.

The motivation for this project stems from my interest in world events and what is popular in regions across the world. Technically I wanted more experience working on dynamic data visualization and using external APIs.

### Functionality and MVP Features

* Visitors are presented with a chart of of globally trending hashtags and tweets.
* Selecting a region updates the data.
* Selecting a specific hashtag displays a list of the latest tweets using that hashtag.
* Selecting a specific trending Tweet displays the Tweet itself, with relevant information about it (likes, shares, retweets)
